**Overview:**

This repository contains all the relevant code used for my Masterâ€™s thesis project at the USC School of Pharmacy. The project investigated the unexplored area of pre-publication data sharing practices in biomedical research.

**Current Status:**

At present, none of involving files have been uploaded to this repository. They are withheld due to pending submission to an academic journal. Specifically, I am in the process of preparing a paper related to this thesis. Once the paper is accepted, I will make the remaining files publicly available here.
